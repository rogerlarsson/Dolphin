OS.COM.CLSID comment: '`OS.COM.CLSID` is the class of 128-bit Globally Unique Identifiers (guids) which are specifically used to uniquely identify coclasses (components) in COM.

The CLSIDs of all coclasses registered on your machine can be found under the HKCR\CLSID key in your registry. Each correctly formed entry will have a human (are VB programmers human?) readable form (a ProgID) directly under HKCR.'!

progID
	"Answer the ProgID associated with the receiver (if any). The result is a String and is the least technical way we have to refer to a component, although still not really intended for end-user display.
	If the registry contains no relevant entry, then an appropriate HRESULTError will be raised. Note that a ProgID has a maximum of 39 characters."
