argbCode
	"Answer the receiver's colour value in 32-bit ARGB encoding with 8-bits per component in alpha, red, green, blue order."

	^self actualColor argbCode!

asParameter
	"It is recommended not to use this conversion, as the result will vary depending on the colour encoding, and so may not work if the encoding is not that expected by the API being called. Rather you should use (for example) #rgbCode or #argbCode."

	"Answer the receiver as an RGB"

isDefault
	"Answer whether the <Color> to which the receiver resolves is 'Color default'"

isNone
	"Answer whether the <Color> to which the receiver resolves is 'Color none'"
