Core.Behavior guid: (Core.GUID fromString: '{87b4c459-026e-11d3-9fd7-00a0cc3e4a32}')!
Core.Behavior comment: 'Class `Behavior` is the abstract class which defines the minimum state necessary for objects that have instances, providing the basic information about those instances to the Compiler and the VM.

Instance Variables:

  `superclass`		`Behavior` object of the instance''''s superclass
  `methodDictionary`	`MethodDictionary` mapping selector Symbols to CompiledMethods
  `instanceSpec`		`<integer>` containg flags which describe the "shape" of the instance (e.g. oops vs bytes)

Behavior defines a number of bit masks which are used to describe objects. These flags are stored as constants in the class pool:
  `_BasicSpecMask` 			`<integer>` bit mask to extract the basic inst. spec (excludes extra spec word).
  `_BytesSubMask` 			`<integer>` bit mask to extract inst. spec. bits relating exclusively to byte objects
  `_FundamentalShapeMask` 	`<integer>` bit mask to extract the fundamental shape of instances from instance spec.
  `_IndirectMask`				`<integer>` bit mask to extract indirection (i.e. memory pointer) flag from inst. spec. flags
  						The indirection bit marks classes whose instances are indirect references to 
  						other objects/memory - e.g. ExternalAddresses. Such objects are automatically
  						dereferenced when passed to appropriate VM primitives.
  `_MournerMask`			`<integer>` bit mask to extract mourner flag from inst. spec. flags
						The mourner bit marks classes who actively grieve for the loss of their constituents. 
						Weak instances of such classes will be notified by the Undertaker process when 
						they suffer bereavements during a GC. This notification is ''''off'''' by default because the
						receipt of such a notifications will delay the death of its receiver, which may result in
						significantly extended life for hierarchies of incestuously referencing weak objects.
  `_NonInstantiableMask`		`<integer>` bit mask to extract the abstract class flag from inst. spec. flags.
						This bit is used to mark classes considered to be abstract (non-instantiable).
  `_NullTermMask`			`<integer>` bit mask to extract null terminated flag from inst. spec. (byte objects only)
						The null term. bit can be used to mark byte classes as having an implicit null terminator
						(e.g. to represent C-style strings).
  `_PointersMask`			`<integer>` bit mask to extract the pointers/bytes flag from inst. spec.
						The pointer bit marks classes whose instances contain pointers (as opposed to bytes).
  `_ShapeMask` 				`<integer>` bit mask to extract the shape flags from inst. spec.
  `_SizeMask`	 			`<Integer>` bit mask to extract the number of named inst. vars. from inst. spec.
						The size bits specify the number of named instance variables (0..255) in instances
						of the receiver.
  `_VariableMask`			`<integer>` bit mask to extract the fixed/variable size flag from inst. spec.
						The variable bit marks classes whose instances include indexable (unnamed) 
						instance variables.

Behavior implements the ANSI protocols `<Object>`, `<classDescription>`, `<instantiator>`, and `<Object class>`.'!
