The reason for this is that pre-declaration is relatively expensive (causing a class mutation when the actual class declaration is subsequently loaded), and so worth avoiding when not required. The setting can either be changed globally (i.e. `Package declareClassesOnLoad: true`) or for individual packages using the `preDeclareClassesOnLoad` property on the instance side.
