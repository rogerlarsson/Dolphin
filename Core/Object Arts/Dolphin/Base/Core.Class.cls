Core.Class comment: '"Instances" of `Class` describe the representation and behavior of objects. `Class` adds more comprehensive programming support facilities to the basic ones provided in the abstract superclass `Behavior` and more descriptive facilities to the ones provided in the abstract superclass `ClassDescription`. In particular `Class` adds the representation for class variable names and shared (pool) variables.

In reality, `Class` has no instances. All classes in the system are actually instances of a parallel hierarchy of `Metaclass` instances, but they do have the same shape as `Class` and are logically, if not physically, instances of it.

## Instance Variables:

  `subclasses`		`Array` of `Behavior`''s which are the subclasses of the instance
 `name`			`Symbol` which is the name of the class
 `classPool`		`PoolDictionary` mapping class variable name <String>s to values
 `sharedPools`		`Array` of `Symbol` names of shared variable pools
 `environment`		`Namespace` in which the class is defined.
 `comment`		`String` comment about the class (like this one), or nil if none.
 `classCategories`	`Array` of `ClassCategory`. The categories of the class, if any.
 `_guid`			`GUID`. Unique identifier for the class.

Variables defined in the class hierarchy should bind more tightly than those in the namespace (environment) hierarchy. Only after exhausting these hierarchies should the imports be searched, again with the same rule that imports into the class hierarchy bind more tightly than those into the environment hierarchy. In other words the binding resolution rules are:
		1. Variables defined in the class hierarchy, search first the local class variables, then those of the superclass, and so on up to a root class.
		2. Variables defined in the enclosing namespace hierarchy (i.e. the class' environment, the environment of the environment, and so on up to the Root namespace).
		3. The hierarchy and superclass variables of imported namespaces (shared pools in old money), then of the imports into the enclosing environment, and so on.
	The search for a variables defined in the class hierarchy cannot encounter cycles. Once the imported namespaces are brought into the mix, however, we can end up revisiting the same namespace more than once because the imports form a directed graph that may have cycles, not necessarily a tree. Obviously there is no point searching any reachable namespace more than once, and we also need the search to terminate, both of which conditions are achieved by maintaining a visited set in a BindingContext object.
