	32-bit boundaries), and it is the smaller of the packing and the natural alignment which is
	used to decide the padding necessary for the field in the structure. Consider this simple
	example:

	struct S { char ch; int i; };

	1-byte packing (/Zp1) would pack fields on 1 byte boundaries so 'i' would be contiguous with
	'ch', i.e. the offset of 'i' would be 1. 2-byte packing (/Zp2) would align on 2 byte
	boundaries so there would need to be be one byte of padding between 'ch' and 'i', i.e. the
	offset of 'i' would be 2. 4-byte packing would align on 4 byte boundaries so there would
	need to be three bytes of padding between 'ch' and 'i', i.e. the offset of 'i' would be 4,
	making it naturally aligned. 8-byte packing (/Zp8) would be no different to 4-byte in this
	case because the natural alignment of 'i' is 4. If 'i' were an intptr, then seven bytes of
	padding would be needed to align to an 8-byte boundary (i.e. start at offset 8) on a 64-bit
	platform.

	Note that packing a structure so that fields are not aligned naturally can have very
	significant performance impact, particularly on 64-bit platforms.

	For Win32 and Win64 the default packing is 8."
